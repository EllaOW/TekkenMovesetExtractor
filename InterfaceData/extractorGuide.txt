Export a moveset by loading up the target character in-game, then clicking the wanted export button. Movesets loaded using "Import to P1/P2" will be unloaded after the next loading screen.
If you want the moveset to stay constantly, use the "Online Player" buttons, and BEFORE the loading screen. Both online players must load the same moveset on the same players.

Both players must select the characters they each will play as their respective "local" player.

- Using only 'Set Online Local' OR 'Set Online Remote' alone will not properly track side changes after loading screens. Use BOTH at once so that the tool work properly.
