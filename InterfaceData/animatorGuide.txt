1. Extract an animation from the game. Extraction only works on a specific, not much used animation format. You will have a hard time finding animations to extract, most will not be compatible, a list of compatible one is provided in the menu bar.
        
2. Select an animation from the list and load it into the editor
        
3. Enable live editing by clicking 'Full anim' OR 'Frame-by-Frame', the current game's animation will be overwritten (use it on the idle animation).

3.a Full anim will play the full animation, changing the animation's data in the animation editor will make the corresponding change live in game

3.b Frame-by-frame allow you to play only a single frame, based on the current frame you are in, in the animation editor. Pressing the Next/Previous frame buttons will update which frame is shown in-game.

4. Lock-In-Place can be enabled to remove any movement-inducing properties from the animation in-game only: that way if your animation has a lot of movement, you can still edit it without constantly resetting the position in-game.

Extra info:

- Loading an animation in the animation editor while live-editing is enabled will automatically load that new animation in-game
- If you're gonna preview full anims, it might be a good idea to edit your idle move and idle cancel to match the animation's length
- You do not need to import any moveset to make use of this tool, it is independent from the MovesetEditor/MovesetExtractor.
- This is in early stage so the tool is heavily lacking in features. Can't add/remove frames, no limb position preset, can't interpolate. Use "Extract" button to save.
- Camera tools can be used to view the animation from different angles. You can edit the file cameraPresets.txt freely to add new angles.
- "Frame-by-Frame" and "Lock-In-Place" will not prevent your character from turning around when the opponent is moving.
